# iCar App

Have you ever wondered what would be the optimal fair price to sell your car? Were you uncertain about a carÂ´s price when you were thinking to buy one? It is not Fernando Mendes who will tell you the right price anymore, it is iCar App!

Whether you want to sell or buy a car, or, like many of us do, just want to know the fair price for a vehicle you can't afford, just follow these steps. It will be really simple, effective, and quick. There are a lot of different variables that contribute to a higher or lower price, so you will need to gather the following information:

Tell us the brand of the car
Specify which model it is
Include the year of the car
State how many kilometres does it have
Insert the horsepower
Lastly, tell us the type of fuel (beer, wine, and vodka should also be allowed. But they aren't)
After inputting all of this information, in a matter of seconds, iCar App will go through the information that is present in the most famous Portuguese Automobile Marketplace - StandVirtual - and after checking prices for similar cars to the one you inputted before, it will come out with the best market price for your vehicle. Every time you run a model, the estimators will be registered in the Car class so you can use a price function for that model more easily.

Buckle up, and prepare your wallet to get thicker (or thinner)
